## Quick intro about Java Records

A Java _Record_ is a special class that has some pretty powerful features.
Records are basically immutable data carrier classes used to communicate with databases.
Usually, in Java, we acquire to write a lot of boilerplate code like constructors, `equals()`, `hashcode()`, and `toString()`-methods
to create a simple data-carrier-class. This is often too verbose and repetitive code.
Records provide a simpler and elegant way to model data in java.

For example, here is a record class with two fields:

```java
record Square(double height, double width) { }
```

## Use cases and common implementations

**Data transfer objects (DTO):** we often write DTO classes when working with databases to encapsulate data and send it from one subsystem of an application to another.
Here is a perfect use case for records as they reduce the amount of code you need to write when implementing such classes.

For example, Look the following two code snippets: first typical Java class and then using Record

```java
public class Author {

	private final String firstName;
	private final String lastName;

	public Author(String firstName, String lastName) {
		this.firstName = firstName;
	  this.lastName = lastName;
	}

	//getters & setters

	public String toString() {...}

	public boolean equals(Object o) {...}

	public int hashCode() {...}

}
```

When using records, we can just write the following one liner and still have everything we needed.

```java
public record Author(String firstName, String lastName){}
```

## Things to know about Records

Records behave like any other class in java, except the following restrictions

- A record can be top-level or nested, and it can be generic
- Records are final and instantiated via the new keyword, and they cannot extend any other class
- Record class body may declare static methods, static fields, static initializers, constructors, instance methods, and nested types
- Record classes can be nested. Because immediately enclosing instances can add states to the record, a nested record is implicitly static
- Record classes can be serialized and deserialized. The serialization process is performed using **record components**,
  and the de-serialization process is performed using the **canonical constructor**

Java Record type definitions can also contain multiple constructors. Below is an example of a Java Record that has an additional constructor.

```java
public record Author(String firstName, String lastName){
	public Author(String firstName){
		this(firstName, null);
	}
}
```

Notice that the extra constructor calls the default constructor of the Author Record. Java's compiler requires this so that it will know which constructor
parameters in the extra constructor correspond to which parameters in the default constructor.

This is being a very quick introduction of Records, more information about Records check the [docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/language/records.html) here.
